Stallone's inspiration:
The film draws inspiration from the careers of at least three boxers; the character's name and ethnicity harken to Rocky Marciano.
The main plot of the film is based on the famous fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner at Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio on March 24, 1975. Wepner had been TKO'd in the 15th round by Ali, but nobody ever expected him to last as long as he did. Wepner recalls in a January 2000 interview, "Sly (Stallone) called me about two weeks after the Ali fight and told me he was gonna make the movie."
<br />
The Philadelphia setting and details of training (including using sides of beef) come from the life of Joe Frazier.
